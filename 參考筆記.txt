React Router not working with Github Pages
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71984401/react-router-not-working-with-github-pages

1.If deploying to GitHub, ensure there is a "homepage" entry in package.json for where you are hosting it in Github.

Examples:

User Page
"homepage": "https://amodhakal.github.io",

Project Page
"homepage": "https://amodhakal.github.io/portfolio",

Custom Domain Page
"homepage": "https://amodhakal.com",

2.Switch to the HashRouter since GitHub pages doesn't support the tech used by the BrowserRouter.
